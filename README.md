## In Breif
An installable package which allows the user to create a one or many n-sided dice, alter the weights of each face, initiate games in which these dice are rolled n-times and analyze key attributes of the results.

## Installing
Download this repository. Ensure you are in the same directory as this repo. From the command line run:

```
$pip install â€“e .
```

## Importing
There are three classes included in the montecarlo package: Die, Game, and Analyzer. Import them all at once in your text file or notebook using:

```
import montecarlo as mc
from montecarlo import montecarlo
```

Alternatively, each class can be imported individually using:


```
from montecarlo import Die
from montecarlo import Game
from montecarlo import Analyzer
```

## Instantiating Die
To instantiate a Die object, call the Die class and pass an array of the desired faces

```
example_die1 = Die([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
example_die2 = Die(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'])
```

Once a Die has been created, you can change the weight of a face

```
example_die2.change_weight('A', 2000)
```

The above code will change the weight for face A to 2000. The default weight for all faces is 1. If desired, the instantiated Die can be rolled directly from the Die class by calling 

```
example_die1.roll_die(5)
```

This code will roll example_die1 five times and return a dataframe with the results. Please note that the Game class will allow you to roll multiple die objects at once. To see the die that has been created, along with the respective weights for each face, call:

```
example_die1.show()
```
