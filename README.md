## In Breif
An installable package which allows the user to create a one or many n-sided dice, alter the weights of each face, initiate games in which these dice are rolled n-times and analyze key attributes of the results.

## Installing
Download this repository. Ensure you are in the same directory as this repo. From the command line run:

```
$pip install â€“e .
```

## Importing
There are three classes included in the montecarlo package: Die, Game, and Analyzer. Import them all at once in your text file or notebook using:

```
import montecarlo as mc
from montecarlo import montecarlo
```

Alternatively, each class can be imported individually using:


```
from montecarlo import Die
from montecarlo import Game
from montecarlo import Analyzer
```

## Instantiating Die
To instantiate a Die object, call the Die class and pass an array of the desired faces

```
example_die1 = Die([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
example_die2 = Die(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'])
```

Once a Die has been created, you can change the weight of a face

```
example_die2.change_weight('A', 2000)
```

The above code will change the weight for face A to 2000. The default weight for all faces is 1. If desired, the instantiated Die can be rolled directly from the Die class by calling 

```
example_die1.roll_die(5)
```

This code will roll example_die1 five times and return a dataframe with the results. Please note that the Game class will allow you to roll multiple die objects at once. To see the die that has been created, along with the respective weights for each face, call:

```
example_die1.show()
```

## Instantiating Game
To instantiate a Game object, you must first create one or more Die objects. Pass the created dice to Game as a list

```
example_game = Game([example_die1, example_die1, example_die1])
```

This code will create a game with three six-sided dice. To roll these dice n=50 times, call

```
example_game.play(50)
```

This will roll your three example_die1 50 times and record the results of each roll in a dataframe. To see this dataframe call 

```
example_game = example_game.show()
example_game
```

## Instantiating Analyzer
To analyze the results of an instance of Game, pass it to the Analyzer class as

```
example_analysis = Analyzer(example_game)
```

A 'jackpot' is when a roll results in all the same face showing. Using example_game, this would manifest as a roll which results in three '1s' or three '2s' or three '3s' and so on. To determine the number of jackpots that occurred in your game

```
example_analysis.jackpot()
```

The above code will return an integer which is the number of jackpots in your game. To see the unique combinations of faces that occurred in your game 

```
example_analysis.combo()
```

To see how many times each face appeared in a given roll

```
example_analysis.faces_per_roll()
```

The above code returns a dataframe that catalogs the number of times each face appeared, roll-by-roll
